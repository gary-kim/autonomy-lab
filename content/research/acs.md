## Objective

We are envisioning a Cooper-based center for autonomous and connected vehicles in smart cities. This center will focus on two main objectives:

1) Development of new technologies that contribute to sustainable and resilient transport systems
​
2) Creation and development of a multidisciplinary educational model that teaches students the concepts of autonomous vehicles using real-world customized cars.
​

Governors Island has been identified as a likely location for both performing research and educational activities involving real-world autonomous cars.

## Research


Currently, mechanical and electrical engineering students are developing a test vehicle that performs fast indoors Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation. The primary goal of this project is to work towards establishing a multidisciplinary center for smart cities that is focused on finding innovative solutions to complex problems related to sustainability, resiliency, and livability of metropolitan areas. The implementation of an autonomous and connected vehicles testbed will serve as a stepping stone towards this goal; and it will allow us to pursue unique educational and professional development opportunities in the process.
